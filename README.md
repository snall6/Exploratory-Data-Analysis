# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis - BDI 475 Final Project

This is my final project for my BDI 475 - Introduction to Data Analytics for Business Applications Class. 
I was tasked with conducting an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of my choosing, and I chose a dataset sourced from Kaggle that analyzed
roles, salaries, company information, and other considerations for data science roles. The project includes analysis and visualizations.
